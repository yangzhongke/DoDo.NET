I want you to create a .NET class library that can extract text from all kinds of files, including but not limited to *.pdf, *.txt, *.json, *.md, *.html, *.htm, *doc, *.docx, *.xml, *.xls, *.xlsx, *.csv, *.ppt, *.pptx, you can add more supported files that contains text information.
The library should be extensible, which means if I want to add a new file format, I just need to add a new class without changing existing code. Don't use relfection, because it's not AOT friendly. You can use source generator(reference only).
Eachreturn value type should contain the original file full path and the text.
The core method names are: 
ReadFromFiles(param string[] files);
ReadFromDirectory(string directory);
ReadFromDirectories(string directory);

Do not create right now. 
Do you have any questions?

I understand your requirements for creating a .NET class library that can extract text from various file formats. Let me clarify a few things before proceeding:
Project Structure: Should I create this as a separate class library project within your existing solution, or modify the existing console application to include the library functionality?
Return Type: You mentioned the return value should contain the original file path and extracted text. Should this be:
A custom class like FileTextResult with properties for FilePath and Text?
A collection of such objects for methods that process multiple files?
Directory Processing: For the ReadFromDirectories method, should this:
Process all subdirectories recursively?
Have options for controlling recursion depth?
Include file filtering by supported extensions?
Extension Pattern: For the extensible design without reflection, I'm thinking of using:
An interface like ITextExtractor
A registry pattern to register extractors
Source generators to automatically discover and register extractors at compile time
Is this approach aligned with your vision?
Error Handling: How should the library handle:
Files that can't be read (permissions, corruption, etc.)?
Unsupported file formats?
Should errors be collected and returned, or should exceptions be thrown?
Dependencies: For file format support, we'll likely need NuGet packages like:
iTextSharp/iText7 for PDF
DocumentFormat.OpenXml for Office documents
EPPlus for Excel files
HtmlAgilityPack for HTML
Is it acceptable to include these dependencies?
Performance: Should the library support:
Async operations for better performance with large files?
Parallel processing when handling multiple files?
Please let me know your preferences on these points so I can design the library exactly as you need it.

1. In the existing solution.
2. A collection of FileTextResult
3. Process all subdirectories recursively.
Have options for controlling recursion depth? Yes.
Include file filtering by supported extensions? Yes.
4. Yes. Good!
5. Provide an event/callback to listen the failed file without throwing errors. If no listener, write error to console.
6. Yes.
7. Both are yes.

One more thing: when read text files(like *.txt, *.html, *.md), the library should can detect the file's encoding.

Do not create right now. 
Do you have any questions? If no, tell me what you are going to do.

Perfect! I have all the information I need. Here's what I'm going to create:
Library Design Overview
Project Structure:
Add the text extraction functionality to the existing DoDo.Net project
Create a well-organized folder structure for the text extraction components
Core Components:
FileTextResult - Data class containing FilePath and Text properties
ITextExtractor - Interface for all file format extractors
TextExtractionService - Main service class with the three required methods
ExtractorRegistry - Registry to manage extractors without reflection
Source Generator - To automatically discover and register extractors at compile-time
File Format Support:
Text files (txt, md, html, htm, xml, csv, json) with automatic encoding detection
PDF files using iText7
Office documents (doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx) using DocumentFormat.OpenXml and other libraries
Extensible architecture for adding new formats
Key Features:
Async/Parallel Processing - All operations will be async with parallel processing support
Recursive Directory Processing - With configurable depth control
File Extension Filtering - Only process supported file types
Error Handling - Event-based error reporting with console fallback
Encoding Detection - Automatic encoding detection for text files
AOT-Friendly - No reflection, using source generators instead
Core Methods:
Task<IEnumerable<FileTextResult>> ReadFromFilesAsync(params string[] files)
Task<IEnumerable<FileTextResult>> ReadFromDirectoryAsync(string directory, int maxDepth = int.MaxValue, bool recursive = true)
Task<IEnumerable<FileTextResult>> ReadFromDirectoriesAsync(string[] directories, int maxDepth = int.MaxValue, bool recursive = true)
Error Handling:
event EventHandler<TextExtractionErrorEventArgs> ExtractionError
Graceful handling of file access issues, unsupported formats, and processing errors
The library will be fully extensible - adding support for new file formats will only require creating a new class implementing ITextExtractor and the source generator will automatically register it.
Ready to proceed with the implementation!

Good! Start!
